# Grade 11 CS/IP Notes

[![google-collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg/)](https://githubtocolab.com/moiSentineL/grade11-cs-ip)

This repo contains all of my notes for Grade 11 CS/IP course from CBSE.  

This is very specific (just for my school), as opposed to my [Sandbox repo](https://github.com/moiSentineL/sandbox), which is for, well, *sandboxing*.

I've tried my best to make it understandable, although it helps if you have some basic Python knowledge. 
You can learn Python from [these resources](https://gist.github.com/moiSentineL/a894ed191fe583db6b90044417fbdd09).

My notebooks:
- [pt-1.ipynb](https://github.com/moiSentineL/grade11-cs-ip/blob/main/pt-1.ipynb): Includes conditional statements, loops and some problem statements.
- [data-structures.ipynb](https://github.com/moiSentineL/grade11-cs-ip/blob/main/data-structures.ipynb): about most things related to lists, tuples and dictionaries (data structure for Python). 
- [problems.ipynb](https://github.com/moiSentineL/grade11-cs-ip/blob/main/problems.ipynb): some logical and interesting problems that might come in handy. (**Please feel free to suggest better solutions!**)

## Support Me

If you find my work, consider supporting me with a cup of coffee, or a chai (if you're Indian, because UPI works!).
