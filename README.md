# Grade 11 CS/IP snippets and others

I use this repo to practice some Python stuff or to check out some concepts while prepping for Grade 11 CS/IP exams.

This is very specific (just for my school), as opposed to my [Sandbox repo](https://github.com/moiSentineL/sandbox), which is for, well, *sandboxing*.

Currently I have only one notebook:
- [pt-1.ipynb](https://github.com/moiSentineL/grade11-cs-ip/blob/main/pt-1.ipynb): prepping for the first unit test.
